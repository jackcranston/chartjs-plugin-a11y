# chartjs-plugin-a11y.js

An accessibility plugin for Chart.js.

> :warning: **WARNING** This is an early release so may not work for all use cases.

We've done our best at adding as many accessibility features as possible with minimal impact to the core functionality of Chart.js. Whilst this plugin adds improvements chart accessibility programmatically, there are areas such as styles that will still need to be considered when improving the accessibility of your charts.

Always refer to the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) when determining whether an application meets the required accessibility standards for your use case.

Accessibility features this plugin provides:

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader announcements

Not provided (you'll need to consider these yourself):

- Enforced colors and color combinations
- Enforced font sizes

## Installation

Make sure you already have [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) installed.

To install the plugin via npm:

`npm install chartjs-plugin-a11y --save`

## Usage

Import the plugin using ES6 modules syntax:

```javascript
import ChartjsPluginA11y from 'chartjs-plugin-a11y';
```

To register the plugin globally for use in all of your charts you can use the Chart.js register method:

Alternatively you can use this plugin with a specific chart:
